        <h1>Resources that I used to build the site</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> I had a lot of fun building this site! Here are some of the great resources I used to build it:</p>
        <div class="resources">
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw&ab_channel=BroCode" target="_blank"><img src="Images/Screenshot 2024-03-23 at 12.52.01 am.png"></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Click image to go to video</p>
            <p>
                This is the video that started it all off for me! Was a great introduction to html and CSS and quickly
                helped me grasp the basics of both. Would definitely recommend to others beginning their own html/CSS journeys. Also big thanks to Bro Code for always producing such amazing and helpful videos!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="resources">
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anybody?query=anybody" target="_blank"><img src="Images/google fonts logo.png"></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Click image to go to font used</p>
            <p>
                Google Fonts is a great resource to find interesting and free fonts. They provide embed code for html so that the font
                can easily be added in the head tags. Also provide some guide for CSS styling of the font. The font used for titles is
                called Anybody and the rest of the site uses Helvetica.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="resources">
            <a href="https://christopheraue.net/design/fading-pages-on-load-and-unload" target="_blank"><img src="Images/christopher_blog.png"></a>
            <p class="subtitle">Click image to go to blog post</p>
            <p>
                CSS and JS for fading in/out of pages was added to the site using Chrisopher Aue's implementation. His implementation
                is located on his blog, where he also has several posts on how to tackle a range of CSS and other coding
                problems. The explanation for the implementation is very in depth and easy to understand, which also makes it easy
                to adjust if you would like a slightly different effect. Definitely check him out!

                Hosting of website on GitHub was implemented using the information from SuperSimpleDev's video. I really like how his calm and concise approach make 
                everything seem super approachable. His other YouTube videos are also really great and I would definitely recommend subscribing!
